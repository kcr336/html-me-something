    <h3>Salvadoran Heritage</h3>
    <p>My family originates from El Salvador. Over the years our family have spread across the globe, but everything began in El Salvador.
There were political problems during the eighties that forced my parents and my sister to leave. The atmosphere was chaotic and the guerrillas
were everywhere. They had attacked several close friends and family members, so my Dad left for California and my Mom and sister soon
followed. They were only in the states for a few months before they traveled again, this time to Canada.</p>

<h3>Canadian Roots</h3>
<p>I was born in Canada, and as a result my maternal grandparents and Uncle Queque came to help out. I only lived there until I was four, but
the memories I have are special. We lived in Edmonton, a thriving place that was ridiculously diverse. To be honest, I didn't feel different
 or out of place. I just felt like I was home. Unfortunately, it was not meant to last. My Dad found work doing lung cancer research, so before
I knew it, we were traveling back to the states</p>
<p>It was hard to leave. My grandparents and Uncle stayed in Canada for a few more years, while we drove down to St.Louis. To this day my
Uncle still lives in Edmonton while my grandparents traveled back to El Salvador.</p>

<h3>Legal Residency</h3>
<p>To even be allowed in the states, we had to get the proper documentation. This process took a ridiculous amount of time, money, and
just bending over backwards to try to get everything ready. I became a legal resident in 1991 and I did not start my Citizenship process
until about 2007. You are required to be a resident for atleast five years before you can even be eligible to apply for naturalization.
After that, its another two and a half years of residing in the states, you must be atleast 18, fluent in English, and pass the examination.
Also, you can't be in trouble with the law.</p>

<h3>Naturalization</h3>
<p>The process was a little bit easier for me simply because I grew up in the United States. English is my first language and I learned US history
in school. In reality, that was the easiest test I have ever taken. They asked me to forsake my Canadian citizenship, but I chose to be a dual
citizen. Once everything was processed, I received my ceremony date. My mom and I became US citizens on the fourth of July in 2009. Due to mere luck,
we had our ceremony at the Old Court House. My Dad and sister had their ceremony at the Immigration building.</p>
<p>It has now been ten years since my ceremony. I keep my Naturalization papers locked away with my old Canadian passports and my current US passport.
 I love the fact that I have dual citizenship. It pays homage to the fact that my family originates from El Salvador, that I was born in Canada, and
that I spent the majority of my life in the States. I would not have it any other way.</p>
